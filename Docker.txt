Singularity - it is an alternative to a Docker. According to various 
sources it used by academic community. They are called "containers for 
scientific research".
Basically, Docker have a problem with security issues. In Docker 
superuser have a privilege, but others can access others users data. 
Singularity uses, for instance, the limited usage to root. Which means 
that only the root user can run the container. Singularity is the first 
choice in academic circles when trying to run HPC workloads related to 
AI.
